## Final Project
My experiment is a variation of the Stroop Task, that I named Coloured Directions.

My goal is to measure selective attention. Reading words is not a conscious effort, people can recognize them and understand their meaning relatively quickly. But more attention is required for recognizing colours. 

The stimuli in my experiment are the words “left” and “right.” The “noise” or distractors are the colours red and green, but they also require more attention because the colours also serve as instructions on whether or not to listen to the written word.The stimuli are presented as long as it takes the participant to press a direction, and then a new stimuli is presented. There are 3 blocks and 6 trials.

The experiment is set up to present the stimuli words “left” or “right” (randomized), and are written in either red or green. The task is to press the left or right arrow keys as fast as you can in response to the stimuli. If the word is green, read the word and press that direction, if the word is red, ignore the written word and press the opposite key. 

The responses being recorded are the numbers of the blocks and trials, the colour of the written word, the correct response, if the participants response was correct or incorrect, and how long it took the participant to react. The files are being saved using import csv and output is read using an excel spreadsheet. 

See [ColouredDirections.py](https://github.com/EGuidry/FinalProject/blob/main/FinalProject/ColouredDirections.py) for the code/experiment.

See [Sub1_14-12-2022_outputFile](https://github.com/EGuidry/FinalProject/blob/main/FinalProject/Sub1_14-12-2022_outputFile.csv) for an example of the output data file I would collect from the experiment.
